# RESTORE MBOT OUT OF THE BOX FUNCTIONS
March 10, 2016 5 Comments

After connecting mBot with mBlock on your PC (Mac OSX or Windows), the out of the box functions are no longer there.....

The IR remote control does not work anymore...what now !

Easy solution:

1) Connect mBot with the USB cable to mBlock (how to read the other blog postings.. mBot should be on, connected with a USB cable not bluetooth, and your should use the latest mBot version and the latest firmware on mBot)

2) Select: Edit > Arduino Mode

3) Select: Connect > Reset Default Program

Done !!
